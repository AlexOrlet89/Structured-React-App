# Idea

I've been spending my lunch breaks on long walks around the neighborhood and calling old friends, trying to catch up. I want to create an app that reminds me which friends I haven't called in a while, and also keeps track of what we just talked about on our last call so I can follow up. I also want it to keep track of upcoming birthdays, maybe the contacts change colors if their birthdays are coming up.

## Steps

lil easy wins here, Lets steal some Auth functions from a previous job, try to get a sign in sign up page that redirects us to a home page, then we can work in a private route, then we'll worry about contacts
